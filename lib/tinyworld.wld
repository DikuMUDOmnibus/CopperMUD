Your Own Personal Hell, With Seventeen Little Doorknobs In The Floor~
   Yep. You feel very alive, and very much in pain and otherwise
uncomfortable. You are flooded with constant sensation through your
every nerve. The source is indeterminate, as your senses do not agree.
It could be fire, raging torrents of water, chainsaws and other machinery.
The exact reason in unimportant, as the results greatly outshadow anything
else. Your mind is so overwhelmed that you only have rudimentary control
over your muscles, with every movement strained and severly shaking. Balance
is a cruel memory from the past, as you tumble over, and over, slamming into
words like like sacks of potatos into a pool of vinegar.
   A sign flashes consistently and at an insistent rate. It seems to want
you to look at it, and the maddening rapidity of the flashes makes it
nearly unavoidable. You need to vomit.

   You are on a road leading north along the city wall of Midgaard.  The
brush to either side of the road has long been growing over the area, turning
this once heavily trodden road into a narrower pathway.

Madame Russi's Tent~
   Folds of canvas form the shape of this tight space, suspended by
poles and coated by a noxious substance to keep out the harsh weather.
Runes of diverse and often unrecognizable origins dot the inside of
the tent - on the poles, the few bits of furniture, and the canvas
itself. The tent is currently set with its exit eastward.

Jailhouse Lobby~
   There is little that the common criminal dislikes more than jail,
and this place is befitting of such an attitude. The walls have
been scraped and gauged numerous times by those who'd rather not be
here, and the bars on the door to the holding cell have been twisted
somewhat from the straight and narrow, but not wide enough for escape.
The lobby opens up on Chatzpak square to the east and south.

   The river of Midgaard passes underneath this wide bridge made of
stone cemented together. The outer wall of Midgaard arches a fair
amount over the river to let it by, and not be eroded at the same
time. A grating can be seen inside the arch, apparently intended to
keep intruders outside, or citizens inside, the walls of the town.

the other areas must have been disinterested in this area and so an altar
still stands here and the walls show some interesting scenes from the life
of Cristis the Kind...a ruler of the outlying regions around Midgaard many
years ago...
  The door to the north has been permanently jammed; the southern door seems to
have been ripped out of its hinges so there is nothing but an opening to the
south. The room slopes downward towards the north to a stone door.

  This king must have been well loved. Great care was taken into the creation
of this altar. It stands only about 2 feet high with the remnants of candle-
wax on its top surface. It says in ancient tongue on its dusty top:
              "Praise the almighty Cristis the bringer of
                 good and justice to the world. He who 
                fought the evilest finally is at peace
               may the Gods remember him forever..."

the evil creatures that have invaded his domain and grave...He stands here
shimmeringly desolid and quite unable to effect the outside world or be
effect by the outside world...he is quite old, but very kind looking...
He holds up a tiny piece of parchment for all to read and look at with a
glimmer of tears in his eyes...
~
E
parchment~
  It says an aweful lot for its apperent size:
     "Hello stranger and last hope for Midgaard and this tomb!
   or just anyone who passes through my tomb.  This is a last plea
   for aid by a man long since dead from this Earth.  I have served
   all my life for the cause of good and hope for your help now 
   that my time has passed.  
     The forces of evil have taken control of this tomb and the great
   Kings of old need your aid to free us and deliver us to peace 
   once again. I think that I alone have been able to make myself
   appear and manage to have the last acolyte here write this note,
   for I am unable to speak, or affect this dying world.
     These forces of evil plan to eventually take over Midgaard
   and the outlying reaches for their own! They MUST be stopped. No one
   knows how long this will take it could be days it could be months!
     Their leader goes by the name of Roch'tar, the reincarnated Vampire
   of a time somewhere after my death.  He is yet not able to enter
   this world presently but is somewhere still trapped here in these
   tombs.  You MUST stop him by sytematically destroying his minions
   and followers who he has created from the dead and called from the 
   bowels of the earth!!!
     Thank you all who may endeaver to succeed and and may the Gods
   bless you on your Quest!"

 Two hints: in order to leave this place you must get the special 
    rod from a hidden vault in a room down and to the east somewhere...
    this room will be a painted room as well...look vault and it will
    tell you what to do...the second hint is that I may appear elsewhere
    in the lower sections of the tombs for more help!

tell that these things must have been worth much but they have not lasted
well throughtout the ages. Massive doors lead off to the south and a small

  The tapesties were woven into beautiful and exciting scenes of battles
long ago. One on the left your shows the historic battle between Jubal the
Benevolent and Hroth Kragen's forces that eventually Jubal's army won (of
course) and was responsible for the forming the city within which you now
reside.  Here was the most inportant stategic point in Jubal's supply-line
due to the how remote it is and of course it was (at that time) the last
major population and mercanile district before the sea...where of course
Hroth's forces were eventually driven and demolished.

squashed by these monsters as well...luckily this was not the case. Tho it
is now appearent that a new threat has appeared to the city and this region.
Though Crotus was a goodly king, it was rumored that he turned to the dark ways
in his dying years...supposed he died an evil man...

The shrine of Mitnar the Conquerer~
  Noone ever really understood why he was laid to rest and honored here...
according to the writing on the wall Mitnar was quite a gruesome beast of
a man...he loved battle...and nothing else.  But many warrior has passed
thru Midgaard over the years and warriors did love Mitnar he was the 
perfect warrior and all fighting men looked up to this man...
  On the wall is depicted battle after battle after battle. Not much 
was really accomplished by this man that you can tell...
  A small opening has been shaped carefully to the east.

The tomb of Mitnar the Conquerer~
  Hmm...neat place. you can tell that it once held quite an inventory of
Gold, treasure and weapons because the wall paintings show dramatic scenes
of men and women warriors alike bowing down to their dead God-figure,
Mitnar. Scenes show get heaps of treasure and weapons sacrificed to the 
Great Mitnar. Even today there exist cult worshipers of this long dead
great warrior and king. Where his coffin was...there is now only a 
rectangular blemish on the floor of the dusty room...hmm...there is something
odd about the floor tho...the western wall has a hole punched through it as
well.

The shrine of Frath the Penniless~
  More blood and gore are settled into this room...the stench is unbearable.
The walls are almost covered in blood and little chunks of dried meat. Almost
as if it were painted on...ICK! in fact there is a purposeful look to it.
  The original paintings on the wall still are visible...but you still have
an urge to vomit!
  A distant moan is heard...tho you cant really place it.
  The normal exit to the south has been totally blocks by rubble systematically
piled there, and the door to the north is barred shut...thus the only way
to go is either east or west.

  Interesting...judging from the artwork Frath the Penniless was a very
generous ruler in his time...an excellent economist it seems...the joke at 
the time was that he gave out so much money that he was penniless himself!
He thus recieved that title by default.

  UGH! the scene is sickening...the sarcophagus is opened up and the mummified
body lies out in the open but ripped to pieces and partially gnawed pieces
of flesh and bone. Rubble lies to the north and the room has been physically
raised somehow because the only exit is downward from where you came...

  The stench of death is heavy in here...you think you may get easily lost
in these caverns...But then again this place is quite different!
  The room has been totally hollowed out and smoothed...and a pit has
been drilled in the center of the floor (though nothing is in it).
  Also extensive gruesome paintings of beasts and monsters terrorizing the
country side; vampires sucking the blood of beasts and humans alike...
the scenes are horribly graphic.
The Ghost of Cristis is floating here...

  Written on it he says :
      "Congratuations adventurer you made it this far! Now, in order
    to get out of here look at the vault hidden in the painting and
    get the key pry rod that will take you out...if you have passed
    through all of these monsters and abonimations with ease you are
    ready to continue. But if not the rod will help you get out.The
    Vault will clue you on what to open.
      There exists nearby a horrid beast called Snapper Joe...he is
    a reincarnated fiend called up directly from hell...he is tough
    but if you manage to kill him he has a key to the lower depths 
    of these horrid tombs and catacombs. I cant promise you what lies
    ahead but it will promise to be challenging and hopefully will
    prove that we are nearing the end of the reign of the Horrid
    Roch'tar.
      If you need to rest and come back, take the rod. But remember to 
    dump it so that others will have a chance at continuing here also.
      Thank you again brave fellows!"

Down the hill, you notice a trail leading to a dwarven village.

Welcome Adventurers to The Tomb of Festeer.
I think before you decide to pillage the tomb of Festeer you should consider
this:

       Festeers tomb, although small was designed to be tough.  This section 
should challenge hardened adventurers.  Most mobiles in this section
are aggressive and they will attack fast.  The rooms were designed to
make run throughs difficult.  The rewards are great but the risk is high. 


If you decide to continue then we wish you the very best of luck.
If you decide to leave, then we hope you will return at some time to try again.

			The Creator.

On the Busy Path~
     Spiders, spiders, everywhere!  It is almost ant-like in efficiency
with one big difference.  The spiders here are carrying ant-corpses,
as well as cats, dogs, and humans.

A Split in the Path~
     As always, there is a split in the road.  One road is strewn
with cricket feelers.  The other is well-kept and suitable for smooth
travelling.  The webbing that was prevalent in earlier rooms is almost
non-existant now.

The Southern end of the hall~
You are standing in a vast hall that is dimly lit, but wherefrom the
light comes, is a mystery. The walls seem to radiate warmth and give
the pleasent feeling of being welcome here. A large portrait is hanging
on one of the walls. A large wooden staircase leads up into the tower.
To the east there is a high passage away from the hall. This ends
shortly after by a tall oak door. The enormous hall extends further
north from here. To the south you can see a huge, and VERY heavy-
looking iron-wrought door. It looks like this is the only exit from
this magnificent old house. To the west you can see a large ashen door.

dimly lit north-western corner of the room. Two large and comfortable-
looking leather arm-chairs adourn the center of the library together with
a huge oak desk. Dim light radiates from an enormous crystal chandelier
hanging down from the ceiling approximately 10 feet off the floor. To the
east there is a great old ashen door. A large glass window is set in the

   Two roads comes together at this point - Tern Road leading into some
deep forest to the south, and the Great Northern Road headed west into
light forest and east into some barren lands. On the north edge of the
road is an entrance into a Hostel.
   The ground here has been torn up by the travel of many people, and
there are signs of many a campfire, and the occasional broken tentpole.

Hostel~
   The hostel is a small, climate-controlled one-room building for
travellers to take breaks in. There is a sign on the wall which
implores visitors, "No fighting, stealing, or graffiti on the 
walls. This will be enforced."
   The world and all its dangers is to the south.

Bones~
   If there is a place in the area where creatures come to die, this must
be it. The ground is littered with bones, most of which have been
ground into small hunks and slivers. Another possibility is that, since
this place is a box-like canyon, all these creatures were trapped here
by some thing, or things, which was hungry or just bloodthirsty.

Waterfall, Sort Of~
   A tiny stream, about the width of a dog's stride, pours over the edge
of a cliff here - or rather, does its best to reach the edge and drip
over. There isn't even a continuation of the stream at the bottom of
the cliff, just some mineral stains on the rocks that make up the cliff
itself. A trail crosses the waterfall boldly and disappears into the
forest to the east and west.

Base of Waterfall~
   From appearances, it looks like this was once a rather important
natural phenomenon. The area at the base of the waterfall has been
beaten down by a great force, and would make a pretty good start on
a bottomless pit. There are also many large rocks which have been
worn smooth by the onrushing water. Now, on the other hand, the
waterfall has been reduced to a small stream which barely makes it
over the top and hardly reaches the rocks below. With the water
mostly gone, a cave has been revealed which can be scrambled into
to the north. A trail to the east is also reachable.

Trail Fork~

here. One, not as obvious, leads north, toward a snow covered peak and
increasing altitude. The other leads south into a pine forest, and could
be considered an extension of the Great Northern Road.

   The trail has to detour around a large rock sticking out of the

possible to get on top of it from the other size, where there ought
to be much less of a distance to climb. The trail comes from the

slope of the rock comes closer to the ground and there are a number
of objects sticking out of the ground as well.

Clearing~
   In a somewhat bizarre arrangement, a group of stones has been
placed here, mostly in two lines, forming an aisle of sorts leading
up to the edge of the large rock to the south, which has some stairs
cut into to make it easier to climb. Each stone has been cut with
a hexagonal cross-section and a flat smooth top, and the stones
becomes wider and taller as they near the rock.

The Rock~
   This perch is a good place to watch the surrounding countryside.
From the forest to the south, to the narrow ribbon of road extending
off to the east, to the jagged peak to the west, to the hints of
more impressive peaks to the north, the view is clean and clear, as
if magically aided. The rock itself has been shaped and chiseled at
in several unique ways. There are holes around the perimeter of the
rock of about the right size to insert poles for torches, flags, or
perhaps something more elaborate. A hollowed out section could be
used as some kind of basin. Down the middle of the rock are four
parallel lines which intersect a circle.
   A flight of stairs cut into the rock lead down to the north.

but a way back would be most uncertain. At the bottom is a 
massive glacier, flowing west and bounded by the ridge and more

out by someone, or something, intelligent. The walls are a bit moist
and the air is cold. Whether these conditions are inviting or

Crystal Cave~
   Thousands of scintillating colors resound off the walls of this
amazing chamber, mostly pinks, but purples, reds, cyans, yellows, and
more. It's enough to blind someone given enough time. The actual
source of the light seems to be behind the walls, but the mechanism
is beyond human intelligence.
   There are passages north, east, south, and west, and opening in
the ceiling with no apparent way to navigate short of flying.

Overlook~
   From this spot near the very top of a mountain it is possible
to see a number of the major features of the region. There is another
peak, quite jagged, to the southwest, and just to the south is a 
glacier bounded by a ridge. To the distant south is a forest. West of
here is a valley with two towers sticking out. North are more
mountains, hardly distinguishable from each other.
   There is a tall spire of rock here, which extends even higher up
in the air. It is possible to climb, but looks risky. There is an
opening in the mountain which leads down, as well.

Spire~
   This is a point at the very tip of a thin shaft of rock. There
is no place here that looks safe - all spots would threaten a fall
off the mountain. The smoother mountaintop below looks much more
safe.  To the west, fluffy clouds float by. One of them looks fairly
solid....nah, couldn't be!

springs and bubbling pools of lava in here. A stone passage leads away
to the east. The cavern extends west, where the floor gives way and

Over The Lava Pool~
   Below this spot is a descending chasm into the depths of the earth
where lava gurgles up constantly, and fires spark themselves into a
brief, yet dramatically fierce, existance. There is a strong smell of
sulfur here. There are safe places to walk to the west and east, in
addition to a ledge in the north wall of the cavern.

The Lava Pool~
   Lava gurgles up in wave after wave, the retching of the earth. It
then slides down the rough and creased walls, not quite hardening as
it reaches into the warmth of the pool, bubbling and burning up the
precious oxygen. Flames flicker up and around randomly, with wild
abandon, careless of life.

Valley of Tournaments~
   This wide, open valley is used for various events, usually in the
interest of violent competition, though not exclusively. There is plenty
of room for a large audience and participants of nearly any number and
size. This point is near the southwest corner of the valley. To the south
a path leads out of the valley.

a large field, which appears to be cultivated. To the west in the valley
lies a collection of huts and shacks. A river runs through the north side
of the valley at the foot of the mountains. Leading down the hill from the

Not much more than a collection of huts, the village appears to be the

mud, and timber. A notable exception is a large rock and mud building that
sits apart from the village, in a clearing on the north side of the river,

Stairway~
   The sides of this valley are steep enough to require a considerable
effort to climb, and apparently the locals have built these stairs
to make the going easier. The valley rim lies to the west and there
is a landing east of here.

Landing~
   This large stone platform rests on a vaguely level part of the

to see several rickity roofs and an alley directly below, though
too far down to jump. The stairs lead to the top of the valley to

   This part of town has an almost tangible feeling of strangeness

is a truely objective impression, just a feeling.

Intersection of Sysphia and Miranda~
   The street layout chief of Anapest pulled off a rather
strange way of avoiding the problem of meshing together the
different brick patterns of the streets here. Instead of trying
to preserve a pattern north-south and one east-west, the pattern
on Miranda to the south turns here and becomes the pattern of
Sysphia to the east. There is a similar turn going from north
to west. A diagonal between the two brick patterns is filled
in with gravel.

   Apparently, the confused person in charge of laying out
these roads decided to give up trying to mesh together the
two different brick designs that meet here. Instead, he or
she used square bricks to fill out the area, preventing any
possible kind of confusion, though the resulting grid may
be less aesthetic - it WOULD be good for some kind of large
scale chess game, though.

itself. The cheerfully imposing Temple of Anapest is a few steps

East Tower Roof~
   From this point on the eastern tower, it is possible to defend
Anapest from attackers along the entire eastern rim, which is
clearly visible not far below. Anapest itself, is much too far down,
being inside the valley, for any but the vaguest detail to be
discerned. A shaky flight of stairs leads down into the tower.

   Anapest has been ruled for centuries by royalty, and
naturally, they need someplace to stay, so it might as

only entrance and exit for the palace, at least the only
public ones. This area amounts to a square cut in the
perimeter of the palace grounds, making it easier to
defend against hostile people. A party trying to force
its way in, even if it defeated the guards, would have
to fear forces at the top of the walls, ready to riddle
a body with arrows.

the corner of the wall from people running into it, though the blame is
most likely placed on wild animals trying to get inside the town. A

Outside the Southern Gate~
   Or rather, outside the soon-to-be southern gate, for it is in the
process of being built. For security, the hole in the wall has been
plugged up until the gatework can be completed. The beginnings of a
guard tower can be seen peeking over the wall. Tern road leads west
from here.

it was more likely built to follow the trees, rather than the trees
planted astride the path. In either case, they both continue to the
south, and the sound of running water comes from the north.

   The river's water is ice cold. The water is murky and deep and continues

The Olba River~
   The river continues east toward a turn in the flow. The water is cold to the
touch with much debris flowing with it. To the west, the river exits the cave
into the outside world.

   Hmmmph. Not very impressive or spectacular, is it? Just a bunch of
