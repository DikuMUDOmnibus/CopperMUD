This wonderful feline is two feet of luxuriously snow-white fur, sleek

sparkling light blue eyes twinkling with mischief, and her cutely
tufted ears twitch about with interest. Her tail swishes lazily behind
her as she walks slinkily along on her rear paws, imitating a stride
that Marlene Dietrich would envy.

etcher~
The mad etcher~
The mad etcher is sitting here babbling to himself and working on the wall
~
  Quite insane, the mad etcher has been here it seems for decades...
His hair is white; he babbles nonsense to himself; a layer of dust covers
his out of date clothing; and he seems to be working on the same portion of
the wall near the base...oh and he seems quite blind.

      He leers insanely at you ans says 'heh heh what can I do for you 
children?  Please dont mind my wife, she is always like that...hello
dear can you make some tea for our company? Oh good! Now sit right down
will you? would you like hot or cold tea? Yes the weather is....'

And on he babbles....

  Yes you can barely make her out...though it almost makes you vomit.
She is missing half her head...the one half is smashed in horribly like 
she took a nasty fall. Her one damaged eye hangs on its own. She smiles
insanely at you thru a broken jaw and missing teeth. One hand of hers is 
resting on the shoulder of the etcher...her husband.

making strange passes in the air, then picking up pieces of the ground 
that are apparently not so solid now. He is carrying a leather satchel 
over the shoulder, into which he sometimes place some of the pieces. At
his belt hangs a strange, bluish whip
When ne notices your intense scrutiny, he looks at you coldly, until you

Slinking around here, with its nose exploring the vagaries of
the terrain, is a darling little chitta.
~
It is a larger variant of the mole, with much the same interests
and good naturedness. The chitta, however, is much more capable
of defending itself with its sharp claws and two rows of teeth.
