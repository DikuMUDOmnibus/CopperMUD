samurai sword katana~
You notice the fine workmanship of the sword.  It was probably made by a master
craftsman long ago, and you now possess it.  You look at a small enscription
made on the blade which says, "samurai-sama no katana desu-yo."  The hilt is
jet black wrapped by light blue silk.  The blade is steel and unscathed.

	To Anyone,
	I have lost my birth control pills, and I will reward anyone who
	finds them.  Without them I will have many unwanted children.
	You should be able to find the keys (YES, KEYS) to the castle,
	since none of my servants fight for anything anymore, and one
	of them should be around the store room, where I lost it, so
	examine the area CAREFULLY since the dust is very thick there.
	But who cares about fighting?  I'm a lover, not a fighter.
	The last time I saw the other key was on a barrack dwarf.
  Signed, The Queen.

   DO NOT ask a god.  There is a quest involved within here, and your
   first hint is that a dwarf in the barracks is your first clue.  He
   is not willing to share in the prize, so you may have to kill him
   for it.  When you complete the quest, you will be richly rewarded!
   Don't think that it is easy, because it is NOT.  Contact Depeche
   when you have finished the quest, or leave a message on the board.
